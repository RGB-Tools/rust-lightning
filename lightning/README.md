# rgb-lightning

This project is a fork of the [lightning crate] from [rust-lightning] that
currently only changes the crate name and version in order to reserve the crate
name in [crates.io].
We cannot publish RGB fork now since it depends on some unpublished
dependencies, but you can still clone and try the project by checking out the
[rgb branch].
